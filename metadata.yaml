summary: Charmed tor obfs4-bridge

description: |
  A k8s charm for tor-obfs4-bridge.

  The charm conveniently exposes operations an admin would like to perform on the bridge, as well
  as a convenient default storage persistence.

  The charm can also forward logs (and corresponding alert rules) to Loki.

  This charm can be useful for tor enthusiasts who would like to offer a tor bridge and would like
  to avoid dealing with and maintaining docker-compose deployments.
